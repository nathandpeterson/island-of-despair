Island of Despair. (game)
Island of Despair is a resource-management game that challenges the user's ability to survive on a desert island. The user decides whether to hunt for goats, plant crops, or perform other tasks in order to stay alive. The interface is text-based with images or icons illustrating various actions. The game displays a table of supplies (food, water, tools, etc) as well as the health of the protagonist, who will gradually die of hunger if his needs are not met. Random events occur occasionally, such as storms, or visitors to the island.
Island of Despair would be built with HTML,CSS, and JavaScript. If I have time, I will play with a library such as phaser or pixi, but since the functionality of the game will depend on JavaScript, I would only include animations if the game is mostly complete.
Who is the user of this app? This game is designed for casual gameplay, but its story is based on Daniel Defoe's classic novel, Robinson Crusoe, so it would also have some educational value.
