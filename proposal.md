Project Proposal A

Island of Despair. (game)
Island of Despair is a resource-management game that challenges the user's ability to survive on a desert island. The user decides whether to hunt for goats, plant crops, or perform other tasks in order to stay alive. The interface is text-based with images or icons illustrating various actions. The game displays a table of supplies (food, water, tools, etc) as well as the health of the protagonist, who will gradually die of hunger if his needs are not met. Random events occur occasionally, such as storms, or visitors to the island.
Island of Despair would be built with HTML,CSS, and JavaScript. If I have time, I will play with a library such as phaser or pixi, but since the functionality of the game will depend on JavaScript, I would only include animations if the game is mostly complete.
Who is the user of this app? This game is designed for casual gameplay, but its story is based on Daniel Defoe's classic novel, Robinson Crusoe, so it would also have some educational value.

BreadCrumb

BreadCrumb incorporates spaced repetition into online curriculum. The app can be loaded with a module of content and a group of multiple choice questions related to different aspects of the content. The user reads through the curriculum and the app quizzes them about the content that they have read. The more often that they get content incorrect, the more often the app quizzes them about a particular subject. BreadCrumb would be developed with content related to JavaScript, but it would be built in a way that the content could swapped out with new modules.
This app would be built with HTML,CSS, and JavaScript.
The users of this app would include online curriculum developers, teachers, and students.
